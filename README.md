# Flask_App


This is a basic app which allows the user to upload the image of format (jpeg,jpg) and then plays the uploaded image as video with a time specified by the user while uploading the image.

This was one of the tiny part of the solution,I was working on while I was on my year in industry placement year. I have learnt the flask framework by myself and have implemented the solution for one of the complex project problem.

I am planning on adding few more features to exisiting application for e.g I am currently working on replacing the frontend side from html templates to React components.

I will be updating the project functionalities in coming weeks. Moreover, I will change the layout for the application.

#Steps to run the application:

1)In the app folder run the command- python routes.py which should run the application on port 5000 (http://localhost:5000).
